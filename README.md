# Hadoop Ecosystem Programming Practise
> An early **hands-on** guide to Hadoop Ecosystem  

## Overview

Repository as the name suggests contains, the variety of *Hadoop Ecosystem* framework components, keeping in mind the *naive data engineers* & *big data analytics students*. 

Programming implementations are done using *java* and *python* (depends upon the ease of using the underlying framework component), by keeping in mind the aspect of *modularity* and *readability*.

## Usage

The developed programs belong to a category of basic data structures like *array*, *stack* and *queue* etc. A few of them gives fair idea of some of the complex data structures (like *tree*, *graph*, *hashtable*, *dictionary* etc). 

Programs represent a control flow as:

    Input file -> Parsing -> Applying chosen option -> Console output 


Programs are named to represent an intuitive understanding about themselves, and are kept in the related directories (Vig. *BST* contains program for *Binary-Search-Tree*). Additionaly supplied InputFile helps verifying the output. 

For example, the *BST* directory contains the following files:
                  
    BST.h
    BST.c
    InputFile

And Std instruction (unless mentioned otherwise) to run the above mentioned program (after compiling it using *gcc*) is as follows:

    ./a.out InputFile

**Note:** All programs except *spell-checker* are done tested successfully. There might be failure due to Big Input file (Scalability has not been tested yet).

## Conclusion

I am progressing to add more informatory files (vig. *README*) regarding input and operations used in programs. 

Since these programs are tested with a small set of input, hence are not claimed to be run on a complex/compute intensive input. And mostly developed to give an early lessons for beginners.
