# Machine Learning

## Overview
Since last decade, we learnt analytic techniques to greater extent, and are able to gain strategical decisions help gaining the business to run in next level. Paradigm is now shifting more towords heuristics and predictions, leveraging our analytics skills.

Additionally, Machine Learning requires to have strong Statistical understanding, and supporting domain knowledge.

I have started as a beginner in this field, and are in ramp-up mode currently. I am utilizing my knowledge on Bigdata, and skills on relevent programming aspects. My prior experience with pharma-data would probably help me in getting the things done easily. 

Though, I took programs from one of the references mentioned below, I put genuine effort in understanding the concepts and added useful comments/logs. Programs would definitly help a naive programmer or students in catching up things faster. and more interstingly to have an initial hands-on to this new world of Machine Learning.

## Usage

In python shell, execute-

    >>> import kNN
    >>> group, labels = kNN.createDataSet()
    >>> kNN.classify0([0,0], group, labels, 3)
