# Machine Learning
Since last decade, we learnt analytics to a great extent, and can able to run big analytics workload easily. Paradigm is now shifting more towords predictions, leveraging analytics infomation. Additionally, it required to have strong Statistical understanding, and supporting domain knowledge.

I have started as beginner in this field, and are in ramp-up mode. I am utilizing my knowledge on Bigdata, and its programming aspect, my prior experience with pharma-data would probably help me in getting the things easily. Though I took all of my programs from one of references mentioned below, I put genuine effort in understanding the concepts and added useful comments are logs, which definitly would help a naive programmer or student in catching up things faster.
